Product catalog with filters


Problem Statement :
Customers often face difficulties in browsing through a large product catalog without proper filtering options. This leads to frustration, longer search times, and abandoned sessions. Businesses also struggle to present their products in a way that allows customers to find what they need quickly and efficiently. A product catalog with robust filtering options is required to enhance user experience, improve product discoverability, and increase conversion rates.
